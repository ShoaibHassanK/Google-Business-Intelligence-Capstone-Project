# Google-Business-Intelligence-Capstone-Project
Google Business Intelligence Specialization Certification - Capstone Project

## Project Overview

### Business Challenge

In this Google Business Intelligence Specialization Project, I acted as a Junior Business Analyst and started this project by preparing three crucial business documents:

- Stakeholder Requirement Document
- Project Requirement Document
- Strategy Requirement Document

### Role and Responsibility

In this project, I took on the role of a Junior Business Analyst. My responsibilities encompassed preparing crucial business documents, handling data sources, performing data integration, preprocessing, and transformation, and using analytics tools to generate actionable insights.

## Data Handling and Analysis

### Data Sources

The data sources for this project were primarily obtained from public datasets available through Google Big Query. Key datasets included:

- [Primary Dataset: NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike)
- [Secondary Dataset: Census Bureau US Boundaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/united-states-census-bureau/us-geographic-boundaries)

### Data Integration

Leveraging these data sources, I performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to create a target table in Google Big Query. This target table contained a substantial 1.9 billion records.

### Data Pre-processing and Transformation

The data was meticulously pre-processed and transformed to ensure it was suitable for analysis and visualization.

### Analytics Toolset

For the analytics phase of the project, I imported the target table into Tableau. Here, I utilized the analytics tools provided to create interactive dashboards for the stakeholders.

## Deliverables

The project's highlight was the development of a Tableau Dashboard, driven by the destination table. This dashboard serves to provide actionable insights into bike usage patterns and underscores demand variations at different locations.

This project not only addressed the immediate business challenge but also enhanced my skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and stakeholder communication.
