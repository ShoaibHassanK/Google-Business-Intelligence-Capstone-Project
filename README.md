# Google-Business-Intelligence-Capstone-Project
Google Business Intelligence Specialization Certification - Capstone Project

## Project Overview

### Business Challenge

In this Google Business Intelligence Specialization Project, I undertook the role of a Junior Business Analyst. The primary business challenge was to assist Cyclistic's Customer Growth Team in formulating their business plan for the next year. The team aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of their customers' bike usage patterns and to identify customer demand at various station locations.

### Business Requirements

To address this challenge effectively, I initiated the project by preparing three crucial business documents:

- **Stakeholder Requirement Document**: This document encompassed a deep understanding of the business problem, the utilization of the BI tool by the stakeholders, and the primary requirements for the BI tool.
- **Project Requirement Document**: Here, we laid out the project's purpose, deliverables, stakeholder requirements, and project scope.
- **Strategy Requirement Document**: This document outlined the dataset requirements, the functionalities expected from the BI dashboard, key metrics, and charts to be represented on the dashboards.

### Role and Responsibility

As a Junior Business Analyst, I was responsible for preparing these essential business documents, handling data sources, and performing data integration, preprocessing, and transformation. I used Google Big Query as a powerful tool to manage these datasets efficiently.

## Data Handling and Analysis

### Data Sources

The data sources for this project primarily came from public datasets available through Google Big Query. The key datasets included:

- [Primary Dataset: NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike)
- [Secondary Dataset: Census Bureau US Boundaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/united-states-census-bureau/us-geographic-boundaries)

### Data Integration

I expertly performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to create a target table in Google Big Query, housing a substantial 1.9 billion records.

### Data Pre-processing and Transformation

With precision, I meticulously pre-processed and transformed the data to ensure it was primed for analysis and visualization.

### Analytics Toolset

To drive the analytical phase of the project, I harnessed the power of Google Big Query for data management. The data was imported into Tableau, where I skillfully used the analytical tools to create highly interactive and insightful dashboards for the stakeholders.

## Deliverables

The crowning achievement of this project was the development of a Tableau Dashboard, fueled by the destination table. This dashboard is designed to offer actionable insights into bike usage patterns and to highlight demand variations at different locations. The result is a comprehensive solution that not only addressed the immediate business challenge but also showcased my proficiency in data analysis, business intelligence, and effective stakeholder communication.

This project serves as a testament to my data analytics and business intelligence skills, and my ability to translate data into valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
